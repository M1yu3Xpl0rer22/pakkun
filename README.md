 Pakkun — Subdomain Takeover Detection Tool

 # 🥷 Pakkun — Subdomain Takeover Detection Tool

**Pakkun** is a lightweight Python tool designed for educational and ethical security research. It scans a list of subdomains and checks for potential subdomain takeover vulnerabilities and misconfigurations like default server pages or unclaimed third-party services.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Detects subdomain takeover opportunities (CNAME or HTTP-based)
- 📡 Identifies known 3rd-party services (GitHub Pages, Heroku, AWS S3, Netlify, etc.)
- ⚠️ Detects misconfigured servers (e.g. IIS 404, Plesk default pages)
- 📝 Logs clean output to `.txt` files (no CSV, easy to read)
- ⚡ Fast multithreaded scanning
- ✅ Works on both **Linux** and **Windows**

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `requests`
- `dnspython`
- `colorama`

### 🔧 Install Requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


🚀 Usage
🧾 Step 1: Prepare Your Subdomain List
Create a file called subdomains.txt:

lua
Copy
Edit
blog.example.com
cdn.example.com
test.herokuapp.com
ghostsite.github.io
mysite.netlify.app

▶️ Step 2: Run the Tool
On Linux/macOS:
python3 subdomain_takeover_scanner.py subdomains.txt

On Windows:
python subdomain_takeover_scanner.py subdomains.txt



🔍 Example Usage & Output
Sample Command:
python subdomain_takeover_scanner.py subdomains.txt

Sample Terminal Output:

[UNCLAIMED-SERVICE] test.herokuapp.com → Heroku (Unclaimed)
[INFO] cdn.example.com → Plesk Default Page
[OK] blog.example.com → HTTP 200 (Active / No Fingerprint)
[UNREACHABLE] unknown.example.com
